# Coursera Project Machine Learning
## Using machine learning models to classify the body posture and movement

This study is part of a coursera peer-graded assigment of Machine Learning Course.

In this project we will use the data from a experiment that used wearable accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to classify the body posture and movement of them. The goal is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, using Machine Learning models to classify them.

In this repo you can find reproducible R-scripts used in the analysis.
